#### GP Transco assignment

* All relevant information is in the notebook file (also, the outputs simply dumped there), as there was no need to generate a separate report for the assignment.
* Included conda environment.yml, but it's only openai and pprint packages used.
* One needs to set OPENAI_API_KEY env variable with your own key.
